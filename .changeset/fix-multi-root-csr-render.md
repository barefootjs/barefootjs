Fix CSR `render()` dropping all but the first root of a multi-root (fragment) component. `render()` now mounts every root element; for the multi-root case it recreates the SSR fragment layout (a `bf-scope:` comment marker before the sibling roots) so `$c()` resolves sibling child scopes via the comment range. The async hydration walk no longer re-initializes a `render()`'d fragment scope — the comment-scope path now honours `hydratedScopes`, matching the element-scope path — so multi-root components mount every root and initialize exactly once.
