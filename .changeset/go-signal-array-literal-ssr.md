Bake typed and scalar signal array-literal initial values into the generated `NewXxxProps` SSR data context, so Go server-renders the initial loop items instead of an empty list (#1672). Untyped object arrays and non-literal initialisers continue to default to `nil`.

`TypeDefinition` now carries structured `properties` (`PropertyInfo[]`) for object/interface types, so adapters can consume a type's field set without re-parsing its source text. The go-template adapter uses this to derive struct fields and bake object literals against the real field set.
