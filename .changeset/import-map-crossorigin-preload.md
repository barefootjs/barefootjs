`BfImportMap` now emits `crossorigin` on its `<link rel="modulepreload">` hints (#1648). Cross-origin (CDN) module imports are CORS fetches, so a preload without `crossorigin` couldn't be matched and the browser would discard it and re-fetch — wasting the preload and logging a "preload was not used" warning. The attribute is harmless for same-origin module preloads (same credentials mode either way).
