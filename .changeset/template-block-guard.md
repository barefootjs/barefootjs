"@barefootjs/go-template": patch
---

Hoist preambles for template-block composition in expressions: when a higher-order method with a complex predicate (findLast, findLastIndex, every, some) is composed inside binary/logical/conditional expressions, the template block is structurally split into a preamble and a variable reference so the output is valid Go template syntax. Migrate all template-block producers (findLast, findLastIndex, every, some) from fixed $bf_result to counter-based unique variable names ($bf_r0, $bf_r1, ...) to avoid redeclaration conflicts when multiple blocks are composed.
