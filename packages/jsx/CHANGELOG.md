### Patch Changes

- 5cf7272: Emit `barefoot-importmap.html` for template-string adapters (#1644).

  Follow-up to #1639/#1641. The externals system writes `barefoot-externals.json`
  for every adapter, but the Go html/template and Mojolicious adapters had no
  equivalent of Hono's `BfImportMap` component, so a project configuring
  `externals` there had nowhere to inject the importmap + preloads.

  - `bf build` now emits a ready-to-include `barefoot-importmap.html` snippet
    (generated from the same manifest) alongside `barefoot-externals.json` for
    template-string adapters. Include it via `{{ template "barefoot-importmap.html" . }}`
    (Go) or `%= include 'barefoot-importmap'` (Mojolicious).
  - Add `TemplateAdapter.importMapInjection` (`'component' | 'html-snippet'`) so an
    adapter declares how it exposes the importmap. Hono is `'component'` (no
    snippet emitted); Go/Mojo are `'html-snippet'`.
  - New `renderImportMapHtml` + `ExternalsManifest` exports from `@barefootjs/jsx`
    (and a zero-dependency `@barefootjs/jsx/import-map` subpath) are the single
    source of truth for the snippet HTML. Hono's `BfImportMap` now delegates to it
    so the component and snippet paths cannot drift — the snippet inherits Hono's
    `crossorigin` modulepreload fix (#1648) and the `<`-escaped importmap JSON.
  - New cross-adapter `assertImportMapInjectionContract` in `@barefootjs/adapter-tests`
    fails if a new adapter ships without an importmap injection point, and now also
    asserts parity: the external must resolve _through_ the importmap and every
    `modulepreload` hint must carry `crossorigin`.

- cbed3cc: Fix duplicate `__compEl` declaration when a nested `.map()` returns multiple child components (#1664).

  An outer `.map()` whose callback returns a wrapping element containing a nested `.map()` that emits more than one child component compiled all of them into a single shared inner `forEach` body. The emitter declared `const __compEl` once per component in that scope, producing a duplicate `const` declaration that threw `SyntaxError: Identifier '__compEl' has already been declared` at hydration. Each binding is now uniquely suffixed (`__compEl0`, `__compEl1`, …) when multiple components share the inner-loop scope; the single-component case keeps the plain `__compEl` name.

- 909b17a: Make `tokenContainsIdent` regex-literal aware (#1370).

  `scanForIdentifiers` (behind `tokenContainsIdent`) was the last hand-rolled
  char-by-char string-state machine outside the shared `ts.createScanner`
  lexer. It tracked quotes, template literals, and comments by hand but was
  blind to regex literals, so a lone quote inside a regex (`/it's/`) flipped it
  into string state and swallowed real identifier references, and an identifier
  inside a regex body (`/className/`) was wrongly counted as a reference.

  It now delegates to the shared `iterateJsTokens` lexer, which recognises
  regex literals, nested template literals, and comments in one place. Prop
  dependency detection on synthesised expression strings is now correct for
  expressions containing regex literals. No change to adapter output for
  existing fixtures.

- d13dc5c: Widen `.sort()` / `.toSorted()` comparator lowering with multi-key, relational-ternary, and block-body shapes (#1448 Tier B follow-up).

  The comparator parser now builds a structured `SortComparator` as a `keys: SortKey[]` list and accepts three previously-refused shapes (each lowering to both template-language adapters + the Hono/CSR JS path):

  - **Multi-key (`||`-chain)** — `(a, b) => a.x - b.x || a.y.localeCompare(b.y)` splits into one comparison key per `||` operand, applied in priority order as tie-breaks. Emits one 4-string `bf_sort` group (Go) / one `keys` hash (Mojo) per key.
  - **Relational ternary** — `(a, b) => a.f > b.f ? 1 : -1`, the 3-way `a.f < b.f ? -1 : a.f > b.f ? 1 : 0`, and the leading-tie `a.f === b.f ? 0 : …` forms lower to a new `auto` compare type: numeric when both keys parse as numbers, else lexical. Both template runtimes share this rule so their output stays byte-equal (diverges from JS `<`/`>` only for numeric strings).
  - **Single-`return` block bodies** — `(a, b) => { return a.f - b.f }` (arrow form; the function-expression form already worked) unwrap to the returned comparator.

  Runtime: Go `bf_sort` is now variadic over 4-string key groups with an `auto` branch; Mojo `bf->sort` takes an ordered `keys` list with the same `auto` rule. Function-reference comparators (`sort(myCmp)`), multi-statement block bodies, and `localeCompare(b, locale, opts)` stay refused (BF021) — deferred follow-ups.

- 6326d07: Unify the importmap manifest type across the component and snippet paths.

  Both importmap injection paths now describe `barefoot-externals.json` with one
  type. `@barefootjs/jsx` exports a shared `ImportMapManifest` (the optional-field
  subset the renderer needs); `renderImportMapHtml` takes it, and the strict build
  output `ExternalsManifest` remains its all-required superset.

  **Breaking (`@barefootjs/hono`):** the `BarefootExternalsManifest` type export is
  removed. Type a `BfImportMap` `externals` prop with `ImportMapManifest` from
  `@barefootjs/jsx` instead (the runtime prop shape is unchanged, so importing the
  parsed `barefoot-externals.json` and passing it through still works).

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 2d817a0: Fix the client `hydrate` template lambda mishandling auto-deferred conditionals that read per-instance `createForm` state (`{field.error() && …}`). The module-scope template can't reproduce `createForm`, so it emitted `undefined.field(...)` (throws) or re-inlined a throwaway `createForm({...})`. It now emits empty `bf-cond-start`/`bf-cond-end` markers like SSR and lets `init`'s `insert()` populate the branch, fixing client-render (`createComponent`) of `@barefootjs/form` components.
  - @barefootjs/shared@0.4.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0111b70: Add source locations/JSX previews to DOM bindings, `bf debug loops`, `bf debug why-update`, `bf debug summary` commands, and improved `bf debug fallbacks` output
- 210563a: Resolve event handler setters transitively through helper-function call chains. BREAKING: SetterRef.via and WhyUpdateSource.via are now string[] (the call chain) instead of string.

### Patch Changes

- 52a511d: Resolve event handler setters through arrow-function consts (not just function declarations) in setter analysis
- ea37bfc: Auto-defer reactive brand-package bindings (e.g. `@barefootjs/form` field accessors) referenced from template positions instead of raising BF061. `value={field.value()}`, `disabled={form.isSubmitting()}`, and `{field.error() && …}` now compile without a manual `/* @client */` on each binding.
- d64f94b: Add EventHandler wiring to TestNode: onClick, onInput, onChange, onSubmit shorthands and on() fallback
  - @barefootjs/shared@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4e4d31a: Add `bf debug events` command for tracing event handler -> setter -> signal -> DOM update paths
- 89a6ad5: Add .entries()/.keys()/.values() iteration shapes (#1448 Tier B)

### Patch Changes

- bac95e6: Extract classifyDOMProp as single source of truth for DOM attribute vs JSX prop classification
- bff7df6: Fix reactive expressions inside conditional branches not updating when dependencies change
- 31ce089: Fix prop name substitution corrupting string literals in client JS (e.g. `"size-9"` → `"(_p.size ?? 'default')-9"`)
- Updated dependencies [2313724]
- Updated dependencies [bac95e6]
  - @barefootjs/shared@0.2.0
  - @barefootjs/client@0.2.0

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 91523ba: Add .findLast(p) / .findLastIndex(p) higher-order method lowering (#1448 Tier B). Go template adapter lowers via bf_find_last / bf_find_last_index runtime helpers (equality predicates) and range-based template blocks (complex predicates). Mojo adapter refuses with BF101 (matching existing find/findIndex gap).
- a5a466c: Compile props.X.map() to mapArray for reactive DOM reconciliation instead of static forEach (#1586). Direct prop array references in .map() expressions are now treated as potentially reactive, consistent with the compiler's existing "props are always reactive" design.
- a57e113: Unify inner-loop reactive-attribute emit through the centralised emitAttrUpdate helper (#1368). Fixes boolean-attr handling in nested loops (now uses DOM property assignment) and adds missing className/value special-case handling.
